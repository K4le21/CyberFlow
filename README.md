## Project Scope

With cybersecurity rapidly evolving and vital in society, many traditional training methods lack engagement and accessibility to accomodate for the new changes. These tools are meant to help cybersecurity training keep pace with new complexity and concepts being implemented, and provides accessibility and engagement for novice and experts.

They are based on our groups understanding and observation of cybersecurity principles.

## Build Instructions

Navigate to the prototypes/UI folder and run `npm install`, this should generate a modules folder.
Run `node server.js` to start the node.js server that serves the files.
